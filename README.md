## About

Hello, I’m Anthony, a self-taught developer and independent creator.

I build simple, reliable, and understandable technical tools and structures for developers, small teams,  
and professional projects seeking stability rather than complexity.

My approach is based on a few core principles:  

* structural simplicity  
* tool autonomy  
* clear documentation  
* predictable behavior  
* no unnecessary dependencies

I learn by building complete projects designed to be used and maintained in real conditions.

## What I build at Palks Studio

### Automation and business tools

Automation systems (invoicing, internal workflows, document generation) designed to operate in a deterministic and auditable way.

### Professional static websites

Durable HTML / CSS foundations without frameworks or CMS, focused on performance, readability, and long-term maintainability.

### Templates and autonomous tools

Ready-to-use scripts and technical foundations that are easy to understand and adapt.

### Local chatbots (Flask / JSON)

Chatbots running entirely locally, with optional OpenAI integration.

### Documentation frameworks

Structures and methods to organize, explain, and maintain clean and readable technical projects.

### Development configurations

Minimal and consistent VS Code configurations without external dependencies.

## Systems & Architecture

Some systems developed at Palks Studio are internal technical  
components focused on automation, deterministic workflows and  
structured data processing.

These include batch invoicing engines (Factur-X / EN16931),  
token-based delivery systems, automated archiving workflows  
and internal automation tools designed for reliability and  
long-term maintainability.

These systems are not published as source code but reflect the  
technical approach and architecture principles presented here.
